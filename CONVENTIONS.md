- Use Pascal case for class names (e.g., `MyClass`).

## Formatting Conventions

- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces or tabs).
- Use a consistent line length limit (e.g., 80 characters).
- Use proper spacing around operators and parentheses for readability.

## Commenting Conventions

- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Avoid using generic catch-all error handlers.

## Documentation Conventions

## Version Control Conventions

- Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes.
- Commit frequently and provide meaningful commit messages.
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes.

## Testing Conventions

- Write unit tests for critical functionality.
- Test edge cases and handle them appropriately.
- Automate the testing process if possible.

## Performance Conventions

- Optimize code for readability and maintainability first.
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficiency.
- Profile and measure performance to identify bottlenecks.

## Security Conventions

- Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Protect sensitive data and use encryption where necessary.
